- Hi, I’m Deolian Domawa
- I’m interested in circuit design and programming
- I’m currently learning the basics of cybersecurity
- I'm originally from the Philippines
- I'm a Junior in computer engineering
- I chose my major because I wanted to explore and learn skills that are applicable in both hardware and software, and find what interests me the most as a career
- A fun fact about me is:  I like to read text-based interactive fiction books, and often mod them so I can make choices without the repercussions
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  An in-depth understanding of general programming, how to make proper comments, and how to properly and effectively communicate with others using technical terms, all-the-while learning what learning style fits me the best throughout the pressure
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  The Handmaiden movie
